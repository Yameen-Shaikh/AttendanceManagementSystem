# Project Changes

This document summarizes the recent changes made to the project.

## 1. Static Files Consolidation

-   **Merged CSS files:** The contents of `student/static/css/style.css` and `staticfiles/css/style.css` were merged into a single file located at `static/css/style.css`.
-   **Renamed `staticfiles` to `static`:** The `staticfiles` directory was renamed to `static` to adhere to Django's best practices for development static files.
-   **Removed `student/static` directory:** The `student/static` directory was removed to eliminate duplicate static files.

## 2. Django Settings Update

-   **`settings.py` was updated to correctly handle static files:**
    -   `STATICFILES_DIRS` is now set to `[BASE_DIR / 'static']` to tell Django where to find static files during development.
    -   `STATIC_ROOT` is set to `BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'` which is used to collect all static files for production using the `collectstatic` command.

## 3. Template Cleanup

-   **Removed inline styles:** Inline `<style>` blocks and `style` attributes were removed from `student/templates/base.html`.
-   **Moved styles to CSS file:** The removed styles were moved to the main stylesheet at `static/css/style.css`.
-   **Added `extra_css` block:** A `{% block extra_css %}` was added to the `<head>` of `base.html` to allow for template-specific CSS.

## 4. URL Configuration Cleanup

-   **Added docstrings:** Docstrings were added to `ams/urls.py`, `student/urls.py`, and `teacher/urls.py` to improve code documentation.
-   **Formatted code:** The code in the `urls.py` files was formatted for better readability.

## 5. `README.md` Creation

-   A `README.md` file was created to provide comprehensive information about the project, including:
    -   Project structure
    -   Setup instructions for a new developer
    -   Usage guidelines

## 6. UI Enhancements

-   **Navbar Styling:** The navbar now has a white background, black text, rounded corners, and a subtle box shadow for a clean and modern look.
-   **Glowing Effect:** A glowing effect using the color `#cdd2bf` has been applied to the navbar and all card elements (`.card`, `.login-card`, `.dashboard-card`).
-   **Button Styling:** All buttons in the application now use a gradient style (`.btn-grad`) with a glowing effect on hover.

## 7. Bug Fixes and UI Refinements

### 7.1. `NoReverseMatch` Error for `scan_qr_code`

-   **Problem:** The `student:scan_qr_code` URL was being called without arguments in some places, while its URL pattern expected a `class_id`. This resulted in a `django.urls.exceptions.NoReverseMatch` error.
-   **Diagnosis:**
    -   The `student/urls.py` file defined the `scan_qr_code` URL pattern as `scan-qr/<int:class_id>/`, requiring a `class_id`.
    -   A search revealed that `student/templates/base.html` contained a "Mark Attendance" link that called `{% url 'student:scan_qr_code' %}` without providing the required `class_id`.
-   **Solution:**
    -   Modified `student/urls.py` to ensure the `scan_qr_code` URL pattern correctly accepts a `class_id`.
    -   Updated the `scan_qr_code` view in `student/views.py` to accept the `class_id` parameter and pass it to the template.
    -   Modified `student/templates/student/student_dashboard.html` to correctly pass `enrollment.class_obj.id` to the `scan_qr_code` URL.
    -   Removed the problematic "Mark Attendance" link from `student/templates/base.html` as it was a general navigation link that could not provide a specific `class_id` in its context.

### 7.2. CSS "property value expected" Error and IDE Red Highlighting

-   **Problem:** The user reported a "property value expected" CSS error and their IDE was highlighting `student/templates/student/student_dashboard.html` in red, indicating a syntax issue.
-   **Diagnosis:**
    -   An initial investigation revealed an invalid `rgba` color value in `static/css/style.css` (missing the alpha channel), which was a direct cause of the "property value expected" error.
    -   `student/templates/student/student_dashboard.html` contained an inline `<style>` block, which violated the project's convention of externalizing styles (as documented in `gemini.md`).
    -   A missing closing `</div>` tag was identified within the `{% for %}` loop in `student/templates/student/student_dashboard.html`, leading to HTML parsing errors.
    -   Through a process of simplification and gradual reintroduction of content, the persistent IDE red highlighting was traced to the inline `style="width: ..."` attribute used for the progress bar in `student/templates/student/student_dashboard.html`.
-   **Solution:**
    -   Corrected the invalid `rgba` color value in `static/css/style.css` by adding the missing alpha channel.
    -   Moved the inline `<style>` block from `student/templates/student/student_dashboard.html` to `static/css/style.css` to adhere to project conventions.
    -   Added the missing closing `</div>` tag in `student/templates/student/student_dashboard.html` to fix HTML structure.
    -   Removed the inline `style="width: ..."` attribute from the progress bar in `student/templates/student/student_dashboard.html`.
    -   Implemented a JavaScript solution in `student/templates/student/student_dashboard.html` to dynamically set the width of the progress bar based on a `data-progress` attribute, thus avoiding inline styles.

### 7.3. Button Visibility and Styling

-   **Problem:** After debugging the "red file" error, the "Mark Today's Attendance" button was not properly visible or styled as expected.
-   **Diagnosis:**
    -   The button was inadvertently removed from `student/templates/student/student_dashboard.html` during the debugging process of simplifying the template content.
    -   The `btn-grad` CSS styles in `static/css/style.css` were temporarily simplified to isolate potential conflicts, which affected the button's appearance.
-   **Solution:**
    -   Re-added the "Mark Today's Attendance" button to its correct position within the card in `student/templates/student/student_dashboard.html`.
    -   Reverted the `btn-grad` CSS styles in `static/css/style.css` to their original, full-featured state, restoring the intended gradient and glowing effects.
